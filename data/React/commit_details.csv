f605175ec7087c39ac6002ed6e1290a2e39c19c1,"Localize Talkback strings (#37856)

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37856

These strings are spoken to the user when using an ascessibility role or state not natively supported by Talkback.

We can enable these for translation by removing flags to disable localization, and adding descriptions to each string. These are derived from MDN for ARIA (used for iOS strings), along with Android and iOS documentation.

Note that this was explicitly disabled as part of D15087192 because of creating spam which was hitting the GitHub repo, but when translation was enabled for the dev menu, this ended up being a non-issue after initial translation. And we really do want these to be localized.

Changelog:
[Android][Fixed] - Localize Talkback strings

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37839

The CocoaPods build assumes that a `cmake` command is present during `pod install`. It acts gracefully if it is not and propagates an empty string path, leading to a confusing error during the build, and requiring a `pod deintegrate` after CMake is installed because of when the binary is set.

This replaces the usage with `Pod::Executable::which!`, the built-in CocoaPods method of finding an executable from `PATH` which errors out the build if not found. This will cause a failure during `pod install`, when we are looking for the command, and specify that `cmake` is the missing executable.

This branch is only taken for source builds, so this will not show up in the cases where we do not need CocoaPods.

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37810

Changelog: [Internal]

in this change, i introduce a helper file for swizzling selectors that can be used for building custom shims and fakes. i tried putting this in the cxx target, but i struggled a lot with managing the dependencies and understanding the extra behavior that was happening from being in a `rn_xplat_cxx_library`. this file is also not obj-c++, so i feel like we should decouple if possible.

it does seem like this is a new practice i'm introducing, so let me know if there's something that i'm missing.

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37811

Changelog: [Internal]

i am looking to add ios unit tests to venice and this is the first unit test suite that will test native ios code in the new architecture afaik, so i wanted to open this up to discussion.

currently, all `XCTest` in `react-native-github` are coupled with the `RNTester` target. my main qualm with this is i am concerned that it won't scale well. currently we have only ~30ish tests but ultimately if we want a proper testing suite, surely this count will be in the hundreds and that won't be able to reasonably live in a single test target.

however, the trade is that this test will not show up in RNTester. i have added a unit test to RNTester before in D31949237, however the experience was extremely painful as i had to manually update the `project.pbxproj` to include my file, and i had to manually determine what hex value was the next one (for whatever reason, this doesn't increment at the endian...).

i am wondering if we can treat the current unit testing experience in RNTester as pretty much maintenance mode and start thinking of a improved version starting with something more modular like this.

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37812

Changelog: [Internal]

I would like to add iOS unit tests, but this testing directory has a subdirectory based on features and not platform, which makes the organization challenging, so i'm moving it to a more aptly named directory.

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37832

This parameter is currently unused and is causing Android builds to fail
as they compile with `-Wall`

This is a follow-up to https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37454/ as that PR updated only the `fromJs` and not the `toJs` method as well.
