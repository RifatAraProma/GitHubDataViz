That's because we sometimes need all chunks to be Uint8Array for the output, even if the source is another array buffer view, and sometimes we need to clone it before transferring.\r\n\r\nEach type of typed array is its own row tag. This lets us ensure that the instance is directly in the right format in the cached entry instead of creating a wrapper at each reference. Ideally this is also how Map/Set should work but those are lazy which complicates that approach a bit.\r\n\r\nWe assume both server and client use little-endian for now. If we want to support other modes, we'd convert it to/from little-endian so that the transfer protocol is always little-endian. That way the common clients can be the fastest possible.\r\n\r\nSo far this only implements Server to Client. Still need to implement Client to Server for parity.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is the first time we make RSC effectively a binary format. This is not compatible with existing SSR techniques which serialize the stream as unicode in the HTML. To be compatible, those implementations would have to use base64 or something like that. Which is what we'll do when we move this technique to be built-in to Fizz.",

The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nI'm starting open source and I think starting via improving documentation is a good way to go ahead.\r\nHence, I've suggested some changes which I'd really appreciate if they're merged. \r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nSince this is a change concerning the README file, hence I don't need to test this change.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

Tests are also passing\r\n<img width=\"1435\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-13 at 11 19 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/b6fe1b0a-d0dc-4ba3-80e0-dcb331d9003e\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking preview of the same across different Browsers\r\n\r\n\r\n**Chrome**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/055ef418-66bb-407d-90db-b6465347fb20\r\n\r\n**Firefox**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/cb192a73-b4f2-4b9c-86ea-6db3244bc9db\r\n\r\n**Safari**\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/2587063b-3c90-43aa-a416-6dcff1f7f318\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "stacked on #26939\r\n\r\nFor float methods the href argument is usually all we need to uniquely key the request. However when preloading responsive images it is possible that you may need more than one preload for differing imagesizes attributes and it is also possible that you may not even want an href, relying on imagesrcset entirely instead.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the `ReactDOM.preload()` method when you use `{ as: 'image' }` in the following ways\r\n\r\n1. A preload call is allowed to have an empty string for the `href` if it provides a non-empty string for `options.imageSrcSet`\r\n2. The key that defines uniqueness for a call is the union of `href`, `options.imageSrcSet`, and `options.imageSizes`\r\n3. If the `href` is an empty string the `href` attribute is omitted from the rendered `<link rel=\"preload\" ... />` tag.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this third rule is that Safari currently supports srcset on `img` tags but it does not support `imagesrcset` on `link` preload tag. If we required an `href` when using `imageSrcSet` we're forcing the caller to provide what is essentially a fallback href. However Safari will end up preloading this fallback even when it won't use the fallback for the corresponding `img` tag which will lead to unnecessary fetching of image resources and make the use of preloads counterproductive.\r\n\r\nIf Safari fixes this bug in the future we can consider making the fallback url required again by disallowing empty href arguments.\r\n\r\nNote that for all other preload types the href does need to be non-empty, this is also true if you are preloading an image and did not provide `options.imageSrcSet`\r\n",

The difference is that now there's a separate reference to it.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit awkward because for multiple reference to the same value, it'd be a new Map/Set instance for each reference. So to encode sharing, it needs one level of indirection with its own ID. That's not really a big deal for other types since they're inline anyway - but since this needs to be outlined it creates possibly two ids where there only needs to be one or zero.\r\n\r\nOne variant would be to encode this in the row type. Another variant would be something like what we do for React Elements where they're arrays but tagged with a symbol. For simplicity I stick with the simple outlining for now.",

We can't do that if we pass arbitrary unicode without escaping it. Instead, we pass the byte length (in hexadecimal) in the leading header for this row tag followed by a comma.\r\n\r\nWe could be clever and use fixed or variable-length binary integers for the row id and length but it's not worth the more difficult debuggability so we keep these human readable in text.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, we used to decode the binary stream into UTF-8 strings before parsing them. This is inefficient because sometimes the slices end up having to be copied so it's better to decode it directly into the format. The follow up to this is also to add support for binary data and then we can't assume the entire payload is UTF-8 anyway. So this refactors the parser to parse the rows in binary and then decode the result into UTF-8. It does add some overhead to decoding on a per row basis though.\r\n\r\nSince we do this, we need to encode the byte length that we want decode - not the string length. Therefore, this requires clients to receive binary data and why I had to delete the string option.\r\n\r\nIt also means that I had to add a way to get the byteLength from a chunk since they're not always binary. For Web streams it's easy since they're always typed arrays. For Node streams it's trickier so we use the byteLength helper which may not be very efficient. Might be worth eagerly encoding them to UTF8 - perhaps only for this case.",

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nVite is one of the most popular bundlers used to build React apps. This PR is adding a vite integration for React server components. It would be shame if the usage of React server components is restricted to webpack or Next.js's bundler. \r\n\r\nThe current experiments that use vite with React server components, all hack into the `react-server-dom-webpack` package and shim the environment that webpack expects, specifically `__webpack_chunk_load__` and `__webpack_require__`. \r\n\r\nWhile it is okay as a starting point, it would be good to get a deeper integration with vite that recognizes vite's lazy by default approach to doing work, and its ESM first nature. One big issue with the webpack integration is HMR. Right now because it caches the modules it loads with no way to invalidate that cache, performing HMR in vite's style requires some stupid hacks. Ideally this should be handled properly by exposing a way to invalidate the module cache. We do this by exposing `__vite_module_cache__`. We also expose a `__vite_require__` function for the integration, (similar to `__webpack_require__`). This allows the user to specify how the module loading should behave between dev and prod.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\n* SSR Server (`global`): Uses vite to serve client assets and transformed ESM modules to the browser. Also uses vite to load client components for SSR. We setup the environment with `__vite_require__` and `__vite_module_cache__` which uses vite during development and the built manifests during production.\r\n\r\n* React Server (`region`): Uses vite to load the app entry `src/App.jsx` with the appropriate resolve conditions (\"react-server\"). It also uses vite to load the server action module when called by the client. We setup the environment with `__vite_require__` and `__vite_module_cache__` which uses vite during development and the built manifests during production.\r\n\r\nA few aspects left to clean up:\r\n1. Reference IDs, how to represent: I have seen them being represented as `module/path#export`. I tried saving them as `[\"module/path\",\"export\"]`. But it looks like with form actions it treats the string as the ID and so it doesn't work well with the array representation. So might have to change it all to just use the old `module/path#export` format.\r\n2. CSS asset handling for vite. By default it loads the CSS using JS in the browser. But this causes FOUC which is undesirable. We need to go through the module tree and track which CSS files are being imported in that tree and add `link` tags for those. Should be able to be handled at a meta-framework level.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a fixture `flight-vite` that's modelled after the `flight-esm` and `flight-webpack` fixtures. During development, the `global` and `region` servers use vite to parse, load and transform the modules for SSR and creating an ESM dev server for the browser. A build script is added to use vite to build the react server, SSR server and the client bundles. In production, using `yarn start`, the `global` and `region` servers use the manifests produced by vite to know where to load the bundled modules from for the react-server, SSR and browser.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\nWe are upgrading React 17 codebase to React18, and `StrictMode` has been great for surfacing potential production bugs on React18 for class components. For hooks, since `useEffect` doesn't trigger again when the component suspends in production, it isn't a high urgency to fix breakages caused by double `useEffect` in StrictMode.  To prioritize surfacing and fixing issues that will break in production now, we need a flag to turn off double `useEffect` for now in StrictMode temporarily. \r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\njest\r\n",

Such case occurs when RN's application being debugged via React DevTools.\r\n\r\nReact DevTools sends instance to RN, which then gets all auxiliary data to highlight some elements. Having `getInspectorDataForInstance` method exposed makes it possible to easily get current props from fiber, which then can be used to display some margins & paddings for hovered element (via props.style).\r\n\r\nI see that `getInspectorDataForInstance` is being exported at the top level of the renderer, but feels like this should also be inside DevTools global hook, the same way we use it for [`getInspectorDataForViewAtPoint`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/e7d3662904e0e35e43380ee6d54859388713a592/packages/react-native/Libraries/Inspector/getInspectorDataForViewAtPoint.js).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "This isn't really meant to be actually used, there are many issues with this approach, but it shows the capabilities as a proof-of-concept.\r\n\r\nIt's a new reference implementation package `react-server-dom-esm` as well as a fixture in `fixtures/flight-esm` (fork of `fixtures/flight`). This works pretty much the same as pieces we already have in the Webpack implementation but instead of loading modules using Webpack on the client it uses native browser ESM.\r\n\r\nTo really show it off, I don't use any JSX in the fixture and so it also doesn't use Babel or any compilation of the files.\r\n\r\nThis works because we don't actually bundle the server in the reference implementation in the first place. We instead use [Node.js Loaders](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#loaders) to intercept files that contain `\"use client\"` and `\"use server\"` and replace them. There's a simple check for those exact bytes, and no parsing, so this is very fast.\r\n\r\nSince the client isn't actually bundled, there's no module map needed. We can just send the file path to the file we want to load in the RSC payload for client references.\r\n\r\nSince the existing reference implementation for Node.js already used ESM to load modules on the server, that all works the same, including Server Actions. No bundling.\r\n\r\nThere is one case that isn't implemented here. Importing a `\"use server\"` file from a Client Component. We don't have that implemented in the Webpack reference implementation neither - only in Next.js atm. In Webpack it would be implemented as a Webpack loader.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways this can be implemented without a bundler:\r\n\r\n- We can intercept the request from the browser importing this file in the HTTP server, and do a quick scan for `\"use server\"` in the file and replace it just like we do with loaders in Node.js. This is effectively how Vite works and likely how anyone using this technique would have to support JSX anyway.\r\n- We can use native browser \"loaders\" once that's eventually available in the same way as in Node.js.\r\n- We can generate import maps for each file and replace it with a pointer to a placeholder file. This requires scanning these ahead of time which defeats the purposes.\r\n\r\nAnother case that's not implemented is the inline `\"use server\"` closure in a Server Component. That would require the existing loader to be a bit smarter but would still only \"compile\" files that contains those bytes in the fast path check. This would also happen in the loader that already exists so wouldn't do anything substantially different than what we currently have here.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nI've heard a lot of the community complain about `useEffect` causing an infinite loop if the second argument is omitted, so I am trying to help by proposing something in this direction.\r\n\r\nInspired by https://twitter.com/tlakomy/status/1501574622839463936 and others.\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\nThis is a fairly minimal change (or at least appears to be), so I didn't test it outside of \"brain compilation\". The pull request is more intended to spark a discussion instead of be merged immediately, so I hope this is enough to meet that end.\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

        "body": "Currently we preload all scripts that are not hoisted. One of the original reasons for this is we stopped SSR rendering async scripts that had an onLoad/onError because we needed to be able to distinguish between Float scripts and non-Float scripts during hydration. Hydration has been refactored a bit and we can not get around this limitation so we can just emit the async script in place. However, sync and defer scripts are also preloaded. While this is sometimes desirable it is not universally so and there are issues with conveying priority properly (see fetchpriority) so with this change we remove the automatic preloading of non-Float scripts altogether.\r\n\r\nFor this change to make sense we also need to emit async scripts with loading handlers during SSR. we previously only preloaded them during SSR because it was necessary to keep async scripts as unambiguously resources when hydrating. One ancillary benefit was that load handlers would always fire b/c there was no chance the script would run before hydration. With this change we go back to having the ability to have load handlers fired before hydration. This is already a problem with images and we don't have a generalized solution for it however our likely approach to this sort of thing where you need to wait for a script to load is to use something akin to `importScripts()` rather than rendering a script with onLoad.",

        "body": "clearContainer and clearSingleton both assumed scripts could be safely removed from the DOM because normally once a script has been inserted into the DOM it is executable and removing it, even synchronously, will not prevent it from running. However There is an edge case in a couple browsers (Chrome at least) where during HTML streaming if a script is opened and not yet closed the script will be inserted into the document but not yet executed. If the script is removed from the document before the end tag is parsed then the script will not run. This change causes clearContainer and clearSingleton to retain script elements. This is generally thought to be safe because if we are calling these methods we are no longer hydrating the container or the singleton and the scripts execution will happen regardless.",

We were keeping them when we originally thought we would come back to being concurrent by default. But we've shifted and now sync-by default is the desired behavior long term, so there's no need to keep all these forked tests around. \r\n\r\nI'll follow up to delete more of the forked behavior if possible. Ideally we wouldn't need this flag even if we're still using `allowConcurrentByDefault`.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nOne way to store a stable value across the lifetime of a React component is to create a read-only state variable:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  const [history] = useState(createBrowserHistory);\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    fetchData().then((data) => {\r\n      if (data.isNewUser) {\r\n        history.push(\"/welcome\");\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  }, []);\r\n  return <p>Hello, world!</p>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the benefit that you don\u2019t need to deal with the possibility that the value could be `null` in the eyes of type checkers (like you do with `useRef`), you don\u2019t need any boilerplate beyond the `useState` call, and the setup function is only called once per component.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `exhaustive-reps` ESLint rule will report the `useEffect` call in the sample code because `history` is not in the dependency array. This is a spurious warning because the `history` value can not actually change over the lifetime of the component.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nI added a test to the test file and ran `yarn test react-hooks`. I didn\u2019t see an easy way to run the updated rule on my own codebase.",

That's because we sometimes need all chunks to be Uint8Array for the output, even if the source is another array buffer view, and sometimes we need to clone it before transferring.\r\n\r\nEach type of typed array is its own row tag. This lets us ensure that the instance is directly in the right format in the cached entry instead of creating a wrapper at each reference. Ideally this is also how Map/Set should work but those are lazy which complicates that approach a bit.\r\n\r\nWe assume both server and client use little-endian for now. If we want to support other modes, we'd convert it to/from little-endian so that the transfer protocol is always little-endian. That way the common clients can be the fastest possible.\r\n\r\nSo far this only implements Server to Client. Still need to implement Client to Server for parity.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is the first time we make RSC effectively a binary format. This is not compatible with existing SSR techniques which serialize the stream as unicode in the HTML. To be compatible, those implementations would have to use base64 or something like that. Which is what we'll do when we move this technique to be built-in to Fizz.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

        "body": "Been weeks, i Discovered a strange activity of React while we try to render a input type of `checkbox`, when i have both an `onClick` handler and as well as an `onChange` handler, if i have added a `preventDefault` function, that should behave as it should not allow the onChange event to kick in! strangely it is not the behaviour it is producing, to confirm the same, i tried to reproduce the same Behaviour with Vanilla JavaScript and it did not behaved the same as of React. \r\n\r\nBehaviour with Current React version\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/dc46658d-6512-4be8-a3d2-e427aa4e23a5\r\n\r\nBehaviour with Vanilla JavaScript\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/b169e74e-b044-4bff-8b15-44cd57afb05e\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that i came to after seeing this, React is sort of trying to retrieve the checked value of the Node, even before our `preventDefault` function, is called.\r\n\r\nIn my mental model,  Initially the value of the `node.checked` seems to be true, As soon as we hit the first click this seem to generate something like:-\r\n\r\n```\r\nprevValue = false,\r\nnextValue = true,\r\n```\r\nand on next subsequent clicks on the checkbox, our `change` event does not get fired since the value looks like\r\n```\r\nprevValue = true,\r\nnextValue = true,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution seems to be pretty straight forward i went on to just add a condition to check for such when the prevent is there to just ignore the `onChange` event, I have tested the behaviour across chrome, safari and firefox and it seemed to work consistently across all!  Tests are also passing\r\n<img width=\"1435\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-13 at 11 19 14 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/b6fe1b0a-d0dc-4ba3-80e0-dcb331d9003e\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking preview of the same across different Browsers\r\n\r\n\r\n**Chrome**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/055ef418-66bb-407d-90db-b6465347fb20\r\n\r\n**Firefox**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/cb192a73-b4f2-4b9c-86ea-6db3244bc9db\r\n\r\n**Safari**\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/72331432/2587063b-3c90-43aa-a416-6dcff1f7f318\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "stacked on #26939\r\n\r\nFor float methods the href argument is usually all we need to uniquely key the request. However when preloading responsive images it is possible that you may need more than one preload for differing imagesizes attributes and it is also possible that you may not even want an href, relying on imagesrcset entirely instead.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the `ReactDOM.preload()` method when you use `{ as: 'image' }` in the following ways\r\n\r\n1. A preload call is allowed to have an empty string for the `href` if it provides a non-empty string for `options.imageSrcSet`\r\n2. The key that defines uniqueness for a call is the union of `href`, `options.imageSrcSet`, and `options.imageSizes`\r\n3. If the `href` is an empty string the `href` attribute is omitted from the rendered `<link rel=\"preload\" ... />` tag.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this third rule is that Safari currently supports srcset on `img` tags but it does not support `imagesrcset` on `link` preload tag. If we required an `href` when using `imageSrcSet` we're forcing the caller to provide what is essentially a fallback href. However Safari will end up preloading this fallback even when it won't use the fallback for the corresponding `img` tag which will lead to unnecessary fetching of image resources and make the use of preloads counterproductive.\r\n\r\nIf Safari fixes this bug in the future we can consider making the fallback url required again by disallowing empty href arguments.\r\n\r\nNote that for all other preload types the href does need to be non-empty, this is also true if you are preloading an image and did not provide `options.imageSrcSet`\r\n",

We can't do that if we pass arbitrary unicode without escaping it. Instead, we pass the byte length (in hexadecimal) in the leading header for this row tag followed by a comma.\r\n\r\nWe could be clever and use fixed or variable-length binary integers for the row id and length but it's not worth the more difficult debuggability so we keep these human readable in text.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, we used to decode the binary stream into UTF-8 strings before parsing them. This is inefficient because sometimes the slices end up having to be copied so it's better to decode it directly into the format. The follow up to this is also to add support for binary data and then we can't assume the entire payload is UTF-8 anyway. So this refactors the parser to parse the rows in binary and then decode the result into UTF-8. It does add some overhead to decoding on a per row basis though.\r\n\r\nSince we do this, we need to encode the byte length that we want decode - not the string length. Therefore, this requires clients to receive binary data and why I had to delete the string option.\r\n\r\nIt also means that I had to add a way to get the byteLength from a chunk since they're not always binary. For Web streams it's easy since they're always typed arrays. For Node streams it's trickier so we use the byteLength helper which may not be very efficient. Might be worth eagerly encoding them to UTF8 - perhaps only for this case.",

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nVite is one of the most popular bundlers used to build React apps. This PR is adding a vite integration for React server components. It would be shame if the usage of React server components is restricted to webpack or Next.js's bundler. \r\n\r\nThe current experiments that use vite with React server components, all hack into the `react-server-dom-webpack` package and shim the environment that webpack expects, specifically `__webpack_chunk_load__` and `__webpack_require__`. \r\n\r\nWhile it is okay as a starting point, it would be good to get a deeper integration with vite that recognizes vite's lazy by default approach to doing work, and its ESM first nature. One big issue with the webpack integration is HMR. Right now because it caches the modules it loads with no way to invalidate that cache, performing HMR in vite's style requires some stupid hacks. Ideally this should be handled properly by exposing a way to invalidate the module cache. We do this by exposing `__vite_module_cache__`. We also expose a `__vite_require__` function for the integration, (similar to `__webpack_require__`). This allows the user to specify how the module loading should behave between dev and prod.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\n* SSR Server (`global`): Uses vite to serve client assets and transformed ESM modules to the browser. Also uses vite to load client components for SSR. We setup the environment with `__vite_require__` and `__vite_module_cache__` which uses vite during development and the built manifests during production.\r\n\r\n* React Server (`region`): Uses vite to load the app entry `src/App.jsx` with the appropriate resolve conditions (\"react-server\"). It also uses vite to load the server action module when called by the client. We setup the environment with `__vite_require__` and `__vite_module_cache__` which uses vite during development and the built manifests during production.\r\n\r\nA few aspects left to clean up:\r\n1. Reference IDs, how to represent: I have seen them being represented as `module/path#export`. I tried saving them as `[\"module/path\",\"export\"]`. But it looks like with form actions it treats the string as the ID and so it doesn't work well with the array representation. So might have to change it all to just use the old `module/path#export` format.\r\n2. CSS asset handling for vite. By default it loads the CSS using JS in the browser. But this causes FOUC which is undesirable. We need to go through the module tree and track which CSS files are being imported in that tree and add `link` tags for those. Should be able to be handled at a meta-framework level.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a fixture `flight-vite` that's modelled after the `flight-esm` and `flight-webpack` fixtures. During development, the `global` and `region` servers use vite to parse, load and transform the modules for SSR and creating an ESM dev server for the browser. A build script is added to use vite to build the react server, SSR server and the client bundles. In production, using `yarn start`, the `global` and `region` servers use the manifests produced by vite to know where to load the bundled modules from for the react-server, SSR and browser.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\nWe are upgrading React 17 codebase to React18, and `StrictMode` has been great for surfacing potential production bugs on React18 for class components. For hooks, since `useEffect` doesn't trigger again when the component suspends in production, it isn't a high urgency to fix breakages caused by double `useEffect` in StrictMode.  To prioritize surfacing and fixing issues that will break in production now, we need a flag to turn off double `useEffect` for now in StrictMode temporarily. \r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\njest\r\n",

Such case occurs when RN's application being debugged via React DevTools.\r\n\r\nReact DevTools sends instance to RN, which then gets all auxiliary data to highlight some elements. Having `getInspectorDataForInstance` method exposed makes it possible to easily get current props from fiber, which then can be used to display some margins & paddings for hovered element (via props.style).\r\n\r\nI see that `getInspectorDataForInstance` is being exported at the top level of the renderer, but feels like this should also be inside DevTools global hook, the same way we use it for [`getInspectorDataForViewAtPoint`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/e7d3662904e0e35e43380ee6d54859388713a592/packages/react-native/Libraries/Inspector/getInspectorDataForViewAtPoint.js).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

        "body": "This isn't really meant to be actually used, there are many issues with this approach, but it shows the capabilities as a proof-of-concept.\r\n\r\nIt's a new reference implementation package `react-server-dom-esm` as well as a fixture in `fixtures/flight-esm` (fork of `fixtures/flight`). This works pretty much the same as pieces we already have in the Webpack implementation but instead of loading modules using Webpack on the client it uses native browser ESM.\r\n\r\nTo really show it off, I don't use any JSX in the fixture and so it also doesn't use Babel or any compilation of the files.\r\n\r\nThis works because we don't actually bundle the server in the reference implementation in the first place. We instead use [Node.js Loaders](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#loaders) to intercept files that contain `\"use client\"` and `\"use server\"` and replace them. There's a simple check for those exact bytes, and no parsing, so this is very fast.\r\n\r\nSince the client isn't actually bundled, there's no module map needed. We can just send the file path to the file we want to load in the RSC payload for client references.\r\n\r\nSince the existing reference implementation for Node.js already used ESM to load modules on the server, that all works the same, including Server Actions. No bundling.\r\n\r\nThere is one case that isn't implemented here. Importing a `\"use server\"` file from a Client Component. We don't have that implemented in the Webpack reference implementation neither - only in Next.js atm. In Webpack it would be implemented as a Webpack loader.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways this can be implemented without a bundler:\r\n\r\n- We can intercept the request from the browser importing this file in the HTTP server, and do a quick scan for `\"use server\"` in the file and replace it just like we do with loaders in Node.js. This is effectively how Vite works and likely how anyone using this technique would have to support JSX anyway.\r\n- We can use native browser \"loaders\" once that's eventually available in the same way as in Node.js.\r\n- We can generate import maps for each file and replace it with a pointer to a placeholder file. This requires scanning these ahead of time which defeats the purposes.\r\n\r\nAnother case that's not implemented is the inline `\"use server\"` closure in a Server Component. That would require the existing loader to be a bit smarter but would still only \"compile\" files that contains those bytes in the fast path check. This would also happen in the loader that already exists so wouldn't do anything substantially different than what we currently have here.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nI've heard a lot of the community complain about `useEffect` causing an infinite loop if the second argument is omitted, so I am trying to help by proposing something in this direction.\r\n\r\nInspired by https://twitter.com/tlakomy/status/1501574622839463936 and others.\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\nThis is a fairly minimal change (or at least appears to be), so I didn't test it outside of \"brain compilation\". The pull request is more intended to spark a discussion instead of be merged immediately, so I hope this is enough to meet that end.\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

        "body": "Currently we preload all scripts that are not hoisted. One of the original reasons for this is we stopped SSR rendering async scripts that had an onLoad/onError because we needed to be able to distinguish between Float scripts and non-Float scripts during hydration. Hydration has been refactored a bit and we can not get around this limitation so we can just emit the async script in place. However, sync and defer scripts are also preloaded. While this is sometimes desirable it is not universally so and there are issues with conveying priority properly (see fetchpriority) so with this change we remove the automatic preloading of non-Float scripts altogether.\r\n\r\nFor this change to make sense we also need to emit async scripts with loading handlers during SSR. we previously only preloaded them during SSR because it was necessary to keep async scripts as unambiguously resources when hydrating. One ancillary benefit was that load handlers would always fire b/c there was no chance the script would run before hydration. With this change we go back to having the ability to have load handlers fired before hydration. This is already a problem with images and we don't have a generalized solution for it however our likely approach to this sort of thing where you need to wait for a script to load is to use something akin to `importScripts()` rather than rendering a script with onLoad.",

        "body": "clearContainer and clearSingleton both assumed scripts could be safely removed from the DOM because normally once a script has been inserted into the DOM it is executable and removing it, even synchronously, will not prevent it from running. However There is an edge case in a couple browsers (Chrome at least) where during HTML streaming if a script is opened and not yet closed the script will be inserted into the document but not yet executed. If the script is removed from the document before the end tag is parsed then the script will not run. This change causes clearContainer and clearSingleton to retain script elements. This is generally thought to be safe because if we are calling these methods we are no longer hydrating the container or the singleton and the scripts execution will happen regardless.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIt simplifies some of the rimraf usages since the library is now async.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n- Ran `yarn build`, which utilizes rimraf in scripts/rollup/utils.js\r\n- Ran `yarn start` in fixtures/fizz, which utilizes rimraf in fixtures/fizz/scripts/build.js\r\n- Ran `yarn start` in fixtures/ssr2, which utilizes rimraf in fixtures/ssr2/scripts/build.js\r\n- I couldn't get the benchmarks in scripts/bench to work, but I tested the `cleanDir` function in scripts/bench/build.js by creating a small script that utilizes it separately.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

We were keeping them when we originally thought we would come back to being concurrent by default. But we've shifted and now sync-by default is the desired behavior long term, so there's no need to keep all these forked tests around. \r\n\r\nI'll follow up to delete more of the forked behavior if possible.

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nOne way to store a stable value across the lifetime of a React component is to create a read-only state variable:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  const [history] = useState(createBrowserHistory);\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    fetchData().then((data) => {\r\n      if (data.isNewUser) {\r\n        history.push(\"/welcome\");\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  }, []);\r\n  return <p>Hello, world!</p>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the benefit that you don\u2019t need to deal with the possibility that the value could be `null` in the eyes of type checkers (like you do with `useRef`), you don\u2019t need any boilerplate beyond the `useState` call, and the setup function is only called once per component.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `exhaustive-reps` ESLint rule will report the `useEffect` call in the sample code because `history` is not in the dependency array. This is a spurious warning because the `history` value can not actually change over the lifetime of the component.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nI added a test to the test file and ran `yarn test react-hooks`. I didn\u2019t see an easy way to run the updated rule on my own codebase.",
