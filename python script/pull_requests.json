When a group is locked, no window or group can be added to it, nor can it be added to another group, but the `moveintogroup` and `moveoutofgroup` dispatches are not affected. Has no effect on non-group.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation details:\r\n\r\nthe lock is implement via `SGroupData.locked` flag (defaults to false).\r\n\r\nThe flag is only relevant to the group head, and upon the group head's succession, the flag will be passed down to the new head. Meanwhile, the old head's flag will be set to false.\r\n\r\nThe flag is set to false when a group is dismissed.\r\n\r\nNew condition checks have been added to the dwindle and master layout to check if target group is unlocked (and if the source is also a group and unlocked) before adding windows to the target group.\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\n\r\ntested locally.\r\n\r\n",

Because it helps reduce weird glowing anti-aliased pixels of rounded elements (in waybar/eww/etc.)\r\n- How? `layerrule = ignorealpha, NAMESPACE`. Both \"ignorealpha\" and \"ignorezero\" work.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you want to mention? (unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\n- This feature works when configured correctly, but no logging is made when an invalid value (not a float) is given to the rule\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\n- It's okay if the above does not need logging. Else, it'd be nice if someone could tell me how to do that (I've tried `Debug::log`, but the log message doesn't seem to show up for me)\r\n\r\n",

Similar to https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/1794. Although that issue was already fixed, I am observing the same behavior on current `main`.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you want to mention? (unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis is my first time doing anything with Hyprland (or even Wayland for that matter), so not sure if I did it right.\r\n\r\nIn `CWindow::moveToWorkspace()`, the scale used appears to be the one from the previous monitor (where the window used to be), but I'm not sure if there are any unintended side-effects from setting `m_iMonitorID`. If that is bad, the scaling behavior was also fixed by only creating `PMONITOR` from `PWORKSPACE->m_iMonitorID`.\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\n\r\nApart from the above disclaimer, I think it's ready (for what it's worth). I tested it with two monitors of different scale (2.0 and 1.6), and alacritty as client.",

(unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\nThe reason i went with an approach of scaling rather then overriding specific corners is that one can simply multiply multiple corner modifiers together for a simpler and non compatibility breaking  configuration.\r\n\r\nSo far my code is horrendous due to the fact that i'm having trouble understanding the current code base. \r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\nIt needs a lot of work, im just opening the PR now if someone wants to help me in this venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As a result, waybar crashes when attempting to call out to hyprctl to get information for eg. the currently active workspace.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a wrapper to the waybar binary, appending hyprctl to `PATH`. This allows waybar to use the current environment's hyprctl, if one exists, and falls back to the default hyprland package if there is none.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you want to mention? (unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\nThis might not be the most efficient way to do this, as it always pulls the `hyprland` derivation no matter what the user is actually using. People using patched versions of hyprland (eg. `hyprland-nvidia`) would end up pulling two copies of Hyprland into the store. While (to my knowledge) this shouldn't break anything in waybar, this does result in a potentially unnecessary copy of Hyprland being added to the store. I'm open to suggestions on improving this.\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\nAssuming the caveat I described above is fine, this should be ready to merge.\r\n",

When a group is locked, no window or group can be added to it, nor can it be added to another group, but the `moveintogroup` and `moveoutofgroup` dispatches are not affected. Has no effect on non-group.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation details:\r\n\r\nthe lock is implement via `SGroupData.locked` flag (defaults to false).\r\n\r\nThe flag is only relevant to the group head, and upon the group head's succession, the flag will be passed down to the new head. Meanwhile, the old head's flag will be set to false.\r\n\r\nThe flag is set to false when a group is dismissed.\r\n\r\nNew condition checks have been added to the dwindle and master layout to check if target group is unlocked (and if the source is also a group and unlocked) before adding windows to the target group.\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\n\r\ntested locally.\r\n\r\n",

Because it helps reduce weird glowing anti-aliased pixels of rounded elements (in waybar/eww/etc.)\r\n- How? `layerrule = ignorealpha, NAMESPACE`. Both \"ignorealpha\" and \"ignorezero\" work.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you want to mention? (unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\n- This feature works when configured correctly, but no logging is made when an invalid value (not a float) is given to the rule\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\n- It's okay if the above does not need logging. Else, it'd be nice if someone could tell me how to do that (I've tried `Debug::log`, but the log message doesn't seem to show up for me)\r\n\r\n",

Similar to https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/1794. Although that issue was already fixed, I am observing the same behavior on current `main`.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you want to mention? (unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis is my first time doing anything with Hyprland (or even Wayland for that matter), so not sure if I did it right.\r\n\r\nIn `CWindow::moveToWorkspace()`, the scale used appears to be the one from the previous monitor (where the window used to be), but I'm not sure if there are any unintended side-effects from setting `m_iMonitorID`. If that is bad, the scaling behavior was also fixed by only creating `PMONITOR` from `PWORKSPACE->m_iMonitorID`.\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\n\r\nApart from the above disclaimer, I think it's ready (for what it's worth). I tested it with two monitors of different scale (2.0 and 1.6), and alacritty as client.",

(unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\nThe reason i went with an approach of scaling rather then overriding specific corners is that one can simply multiply multiple corner modifiers together for a simpler and non compatibility breaking  configuration.\r\n\r\nSo far my code is horrendous due to the fact that i'm having trouble understanding the current code base. \r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\nIt needs a lot of work, im just opening the PR now if someone wants to help me in this venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "#### Describe your PR, what does it fix/add?\r\nIn some environments, such as using the [home-manager waybar module's systemd integration](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/master/modules/programs/waybar.nix#L198), hyprctl may not be in `PATH`. As a result, waybar crashes when attempting to call out to hyprctl to get information for eg. the currently active workspace.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a wrapper to the waybar binary, appending hyprctl to `PATH`. This allows waybar to use the current environment's hyprctl, if one exists, and falls back to the default hyprland package if there is none.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you want to mention? (unchecked code, possible bugs, found problems, breaking compatibility, etc.)\r\nThis might not be the most efficient way to do this, as it always pulls the `hyprland` derivation no matter what the user is actually using. People using patched versions of hyprland (eg. `hyprland-nvidia`) would end up pulling two copies of Hyprland into the store. While (to my knowledge) this shouldn't break anything in waybar, this does result in a potentially unnecessary copy of Hyprland being added to the store. I'm open to suggestions on improving this.\r\n\r\n#### Is it ready for merging, or does it need work?\r\nAssuming the caveat I described above is fine, this should be ready to merge.\r\n",
